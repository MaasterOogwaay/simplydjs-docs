## v4.x.x

- #### All new `strict` mode.
  * This new strict mode makes sure everything runs perfectly. Will throw an error if anything goes wrong. Defaults to`false`

<br></br>

- #### Proper Typings and Commenting
  * Now every argument or every variable is type-safe.

<br></br>

- #### ChatGPT integration in chatbot
  * We have integrated ChatGPT (OpenAI API) into the chatbot function. Look its documentation for <a class="link" href="/docs/fun/chatbot/">More info</a>

<br></br>

- #### Super Customizable embed
  * We added `fields`, `thumbnail`, `image` and literally everything that Discord.JS provides for embed. So you can customize even more. Making your bot, yours. Refer [`CustomizableEmbed`](/docs/typedef/CustomizableEmbed/)

<br></br>

- #### Names that just make sense
  * Previously we had meaningless variable and option names. Now that's gone. Everything has proper name. Making it easier to contribute and debug.

<br></br>

- #### Removed `credit` option
  * We listened to the people. We heared that the `credit` option annoys people. So that's gone too.

<br></br>

- #### Deprecated few modules
  * As we said earlier, We had meaningless names. Now that's changed with a proper name, leading to deprecation of old names.

```js
// Ordinary functions
automeme() --> meme()
bumpSys() --> bumpReminder()
embedCreate() --> embedCreator()
embedPages() --> buttonPages()
giveawaySystem() --> giveaway()
suggestSystem() --> suggest()
ticketSystem() --> ticketSetup()

// System Handlers
manageBtn() 
  |--> manageBtnRole()
  |--> manageTicket()
  \--> manageGiveaway() // Splitted into three separate handlers

manageSug() --> manageSuggest()

// Deprecated and will be removed
nqn() --> X
stealEmoji() --> X
```
