## What is this ?

- ### This is the official documentation for <a href="https://github.com/simply-devlop/simply-djs">simply-djs</a> package
- - This documentation uses Meta's Docusaurus framework (Uses React)
- - This is fully made with **Markdown** and **CSS**
- - The one who contributes don't need to be a Html/CSS pro.
- - This is not meant to be forked and be modified. (as it doesn't have any license)

## How to

<details>
  <summary><h3>Edit/Change the text</h3></summary>
  
  ## It is just a normal `Markdown` file.
  It's very identical to a normal `.txt` (text) file with some spicyness
  
 > Just don't ! Edit ! the CSS !
  
  # Editing
  Lets say you have to edit some specific file
  
  - ### Create a fork
  - ### Go to `docs` folder and select a category folder
  - ### Choose your desired file
  - ### Edit it ;)
  - ### After finishing, Create a pull request
  - ### We will take care about it after then.

<details>
  <summary><h3>Add new function ?</h3></summary>
  
  ### As per Docusaurus, Every file inside a folder runs as a route.

  Can't understand ? Me neither ;>
  
  #### Lets say, We have a file named `toRgb` inside `misc` folder.
  
  So when its publically available, you can use `https://simplyd.js.org/docs/misc/torgb.md` url.
  Where
  - #### **misc** is the `folder` and
  - #### **torgb.md** is the `file` (with extension)
  
  So you can create a `{name}` inside its category to make it work

<details>
  <summary><h3>Maintain the sidebar ?</h3></summary>
  
  ## Don't worry
  ### Docusaurus automatically adds new files to the sidebar.
